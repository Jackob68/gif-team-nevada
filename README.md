GIF Encoding Library
====================

This is an unfinished implementation of GIF encoding library.
The library misses implementation of the actual LZW compression and also
optional features (animation etc.).

Running and compiling
---------------------

`ant test` executes the built-in tests, `ant demo` launches a simple
comparison test.

Tests
-----
`GifWriterTest` and `LzwCompressionTest` are prepared with some example
data.
They have to be modified once the implementation is ready to be fully
executed.
